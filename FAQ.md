  <summary>What is the difference between <code>individualCount</code>, and <code>organismQuantity</code>, and which one should I use?

  The DwC term `individualCount` is used simply for documenting the *number of individuals* present at the time the occurrence happened. Conversely, `organismQuantity` is used to record *any type* of quantity related to an organism or occurrence. `organismQuantityType` may include the number of individuals, the % cover, biomass, the cover-abundance on the Braun-Blanquet Scale, etc. While both DwC terms can be placed in the Occurrence table, OBIS recommends also populating them in the eMoF table because of the standardization of terms and because you can link to sampling events and factual sampling information.

  <li><details>
  <summary>Do I have to provide decimalLatitude and decimalLongitude for the Event <i>and</i> Occurrence tables?</summary>
  
  The answer may depend on your dataset structure, but generally, no. If you have Event core, then you do not need to repeat location information in the Occurrence table (but you can if you'd like). If you are using Occurrence core, then location information must be provided in the Occurrence table.

  <li><details>
  <summary>Can I have multiple eMoF tables, one for Event and one for Occurrence measurements?</summary>
  
  Yes, you can create multiple eMoF tables if it is simpler for you to separate Event and Occurrence measurement data. However, you must ensure all tables include the correct identifiers, i.e. eventID for measurements related to events, and occurrenceID *and* eventID for measurements associated with occurrences. When you add multiple tables of the same type in the IPT, they will be treated as if they were a single table, so there is no issue if you would like to do this.

  <summary>How do I document occurrences from unknown species, those new to science, or those with temporary names? e.g. Eurythenes sp. DISCOLL.PAP.JC165.674</summary>

  Occurrences unknown or new to science should be documented according to recommendations by [Horton et al. 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.620702/full). You should populate the `scientificName` field with the genus, and in `identificationQualifer` provide the ON sign 'sp.'. However you must also indicate the reason why species-level identification is unavailable. To do this, supplement 'sp.' with either stet. (stetit) or indet. (indeterminabilis). If neither of these are applicable, (e.g. for undescribed new species), add a unique taxon identifier code after 'sp.' to `identificationQualifer`. For example Eurythenes sp. DISCOLL.PAP.JC165.674.
  
  Please avoid simple alphanumeric codes (i.e. Eurythenes sp. 1, Eurythenes sp. A). Similar to creating `eventIDs` or `occurrenceIDs`, you should strive to provide more complex and globally unique identifier. Identifiers could be constructed by combining higher taxonomic information with information related to a collection, institution, museum or collection code, sample number or museum accession number, expedition, dive number, or timestamp. This ensures namestrings will remain unique within a larger repositories like OBIS. It is also recommended to include these temporary names on specimen labels for physical specimens.

  <summary>Should I use taxon-specific P01 codes to populate for measurementTypeID? e.g. <link>http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P01/current/A15985A1</link> </summary>

  No. You should never use taxon-specific P01 codes. This is because the taxa are already identified in the Occurrence table, in the fields `scientificName` and `scientificNameID`.

  <li><a href="name_matching.html#what-to-do-with-non-matching-names">What do I do if my scientificName does not return a match from WoRMS?</a></li>
  <li><details>
  <summary>Can scientificNameID be populated with an identifier (e.g. WoRMS LSID) representing an unaccepted taxon name?</summary>

  Yes. The identifier in `scientificNameID` should always correspond with the name that is in the `scientificName` field, even if the name is an unaccepted name in WoRMS. For example, the species name "Holothuria mammiculata" was provided, but this name is unaccepted in WoRMS. The accepted name is "Holothuria (Stauropora) pervicax Selenka, 1867". In this case `scientificNameID` should correspond to the original name with LSID urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:529968 because the ID must correlate with the name as recorded in `scientificName`.

  <summary>Is there a template generator I can use to help create my Event, Occurrence, and eMoF tables?</summary>

  Yes. There is an [Excel template generator](https://www.nordatanet.no/aen/template-generator/config%3DDarwin%20Core) developed by Luke Marsden & Olaf Schneider as part of the Nansen Legacy project. Note this template generator is aimed at GBIF users, so make to account for and include required OBIS terms.

  There is also this [Excel to Darwin Core macro tool](https://zenodo.org/record/6453921#.Y9KsQkHMKmU) developed by GBIF Norway you can use to help generate templates.

#### Accessing data in OBIS

<ul>
  <li><details>
  <summary>Can I get (or publish) other types of information from OBIS, besides occurences (e.g. bio-eco variables, DNA data, abiotic measurements, etc.)?</summary>

  Yes! OBIS allows access to not only taxa occurrences, but also all kinds of measurement data including DNA data (see [Contribute](contribute.html) for a list of data accepted by OBIS). This data is recorded in the (Extended) Measurement Or Fact and DNA-Derived Data extension tables, respectively. To access this data when downloading, be sure to select MoF or DNA from the dropdown Dataset Type menu on the [advanced dataset serach page](https://obis.org/datasets). If you are obtaining data from the OBIS Mapper, make sure to check the box for MeasurementOrFact and/or DNADerivedData from the Extensions toggle section. When using the R package robis, use the `mof=TRUE` and/or `dna=TRUE` arguments. More data filter options will be added in the future.

  <li><details>
  <summary>How do I load the full (.csv) export of OBIS data?</summary>
  
  Loading the entire OBIS dataset uses *a lot* of memory and is probably not feasible on most desktop computers. You have a few potential options depending on the use case: i) process the data in smaller batches, or ii) load the dataset into a local database such as SQLite and use SQL queries to analyze the data
  
  Otherwise, we recommend you use the parquet download which is available [here](https://obis.org/data/access/), instead of the CSV. Then in R, you can use the [`arrow`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/) package to work with parquet files. We also have a short tutorial on working with parquet files in R [here](https://resources.obis.org/tutorials/arrow-obis/), with an example application of this approach [here](https://iobis.github.io/notebook-diversity-indicators/) (see first code block).

  <li><details>
  <summary>How do I obtain a taxon checklist for an area?</summary>
  
  There are a few possible ways to obtain a taxon checklist for a given area. We will obtain a checklist of species in the Albain EEZ as an example. To do this we will create a bounding box around our area of interest, and then apply filters to simplify the geometry.

  ```R
  library(mregions)
  library(dplyr)
  library(robis)
  library(sf)
  #obtain Albanian EEZ as sf
  geom <- mr_shp(key = "MarineRegions:eez", filter = "Albanian Exclusive Economic Zone", maxFeatures = NULL)
  #get WKT for the bounding box
  wkt <- st_as_text(st_as_sfc(st_bbox(geom)), digits = 6)
  #fetch occurrences for bounding box
  occ <- occurrence(geometry = wkt) %>%
    st_as_sf(coords = c("decimalLongitude", "decimalLatitude"), crs = 4326)
  #filter using geometry
  occ_filtered <- occ %>%
    filter(st_intersects(geometry, geom, sparse = FALSE)) %>%
    as_tibble() %>%
    select(-geometry)
  #get taxa
  alb_taxa <- occ_filtered %>%
    group_by(phylum, class, order, family, genus, species, scientificName) %>%
    summarize(records = n())
  ```

  </details></li>
  <li><details><summary>The dates look unusual in the download file. What are these, how do I convert them, and/or how do I obtain separate elements from them (e.g. month)?</summary>
  
  The values in `date_start`, `date_mid`, and `date_end` are unix timestamps which have been calculated from the ISO date in the `eventDate` column. We can convert these numerical values to dates using the formula below.

  ```Excel
  =(E2/86400000)+DATE(1970,1,1)
  ```

  If, when you apply this formula, you still see numbers, you will need to set the cell formatting to Date. Once you have dates, you can obtain, e.g. months for seasonal analyses using:
  
  ```Excel
  =MONTH(H2)
  ```

  You can also use [this tool](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) to convert timestamps.

  <li><details>
  <summary>How do I filter by or obtain trait information for OBIS data (e.g. all benthic organisms)?</summary>
  
  Currently, it is not possible to filter OBIS data by trait. To do this, we recommend using the traits database of the [World Register of Marine Species](https://www.marinespecies.org/traits/aphia.php?p=attributes). For example, searching by “functional group”, you can specify benthos, plankton, nekton, etc.
