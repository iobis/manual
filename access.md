## Mapper

- <https://mapper.obis.org>

The mapper allows users to visualize and inspect subsets of OBIS data. A variety of filters (taxonomic, geographic, time, data quality) is available and multiple layers can be combined in a single view. Layers can be downloaded as CSV files.

## R package

- <https://github.com/iobis/robis>

The robis R package has been developed to facilitate connecting to the OBIS API from R. The package can be installed [from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/robis/index.html) or [from GitHub](https://github.com/iobis/robis) (latest development version). The package documentation including a function reference and a [getting started vignette](https://iobis.github.io/robis/articles/getting-started.html) is available at [https://iobis.github.io/robis/](https://iobis.github.io/robis/).

## API

- <https://api.obis.org/>

Both the mapper and the R package are based on the OBIS API which can be used by third party developers as well.
