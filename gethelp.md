## Getting Help in OBIS

If you require additional assistance with OBIS we recommend you first get in touch with the most [relevant OBIS node](https://obis.org/contact/). We also have a **support channel** on [Slack](https://obishq.slack.com/archives/C014PTTKECW) where you can communicate with the OBIS community for help. Please feel comfortable posting to this channel before reaching out to the OBIS Secretariat (<helpdesk@obis.org>). The OBIS community is quite active on Slack and GithHub (see below) so you are more likely to receive a quick answer to your question by posting in either place, as the Secretariat receives many requests.

You can submit issues and questions on relevant Github repositories:

* [OBIS Manual](https://github.com/iobis/manual/issues)
* [OBIS Website](https://github.com/iobis/web)
* [OBIS issues GitHub repo](https://github.com/iobis/obis-issues)
* [OBIS quality control issues](https://github.com/iobis/obis-qc)
* [All other OBIS repositories](https://github.com/iobis)

We strongly recommend creating a GitHub account to engage with the OBIS community, document issues, ask questions, find datasets that need endorsing, etc. GitHub gives threads a more permanent home and allows for open communication and transparency. If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, the Carpentries have [these training resources](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/index.html) which you can reference.
