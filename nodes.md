Additionally, assistance in publishing data to global aggregators like OBIS and GBIF, utilizing relevant technologies, and applying our community standards and best practices
* Encouraged to engage in adjacent and affiliated user communities and actively seek new partners (e.g. data providers, data using partners)

**Notes:**

* OBIS nodes are eligible to become a member of the SG and have voting rights. A formal letter expressing their commitment to contribute according to Terms of Reference of the SG must be renewed every 2 years
* OBIS nodes can become a member of and contribute to the various OBIS coordination groups

### How to become an OBIS node

OBIS nodes now operate under the IODE network as either National Oceanographic Data Centres (NODCs) or Associate Data Unites (ADUs). Prospective nodes are required to apply to the IODE for membership.

The procedure to become an OBIS node is as follows:

* If you are an existing NODC (within the IODE network) and the OBIS node activities fall under the activities of the NODC:
  * Send a letter expressing your interest to become an OBIS node (including contact information of the OBIS node manager, and geographical/thematic scope of your OBIS node)
* If you are not an existing NODC:
  * Email your [application form](http://iode.org/index.php?option=com_oe&task=viewDocumentRecord&docID=11793) to become an IODE Associate Data Unit (ADU), with a specific role as OBIS node. Applications for ADU membership in OBIS shall be reviewed by the IODE Officers in consultation with the IODE Steering Group for OBIS.

### OBIS Node Health Status Check and Transition Strategy {.unlisted .unnumbered}

OBIS nodes should operate under IODE as either IODE/ADU or IODE/NODC. As such OBIS nodes are a member of the IODE network.

The IODE Steering Group (SG) for OBIS evaluates the health status of OBIS nodes at each annual SG meeting, and considers an OBIS node as **inactive** when it meets any of the following conditions:

1. The OBIS node manager recurrently fails to answer the communications from the project manager or the SG co-chairs in the last 12 months
2. The OBIS node manager or a representative fails to attend (personally or virtually) the last 2 SG meetings without any written reason
3. The OBIS node does not have an IPT
4. The OBIS node has an IPT, but it has not been running for the last 12 months
5. The datasets in the OBIS node's IPT have been removed and not restored in the last 12 months (without any explanation)
6. The OBIS node has not provided new data for the last 2 years

The OBIS Secretariat prepares a health status check report of each OBIS node based on the six items above and informs the OBIS node manager on their status 3 months before the SG meeting. At the SG meeting, the SG-OBIS co-chair will present the results of the OBIS nodes health status check report including a listing of the inactive OBIS nodes.
The SG-OBIS members representing active OBIS Nodes will make one of the following decisions:

1. Request the inactive OBIS node to submit a plan with actions, deliverables and times to improve their performance, within 3 months, to the OBIS Secretariat. This plan is reviewed and accepted by the OBIS-Executive Committee
Or
2. Provide a recommendation to the IOC Committee on IODE to remove the OBIS node from the IODE network.

In either case, the OBIS Secretariat will inform the OBIS node manager of the SG-OBIS decision, with a copy to the IODE officers and the IODE national coordinator for data management of the country concerned.

The IODE Committee is requested to consider the recommendation from the OBIS Steering Group and it may either accept the recommendation or request the inactive OBIS node to submit an action plan (option 1).

When the inactive OBIS node is removed from the IODE network, the SG-OBIS will ask whether another OBIS node is interested in taking over the responsibilities of the removed OBIS node, until a new OBIS node in the country/region is established.

## TOR of OBIS Steering Group

**Required**

* Propose, and revise as necessary, the vision, mission, objectives, strategies (e.g. sustainability), management structure, work plans, budgets and timetables for OBIS

* In exceptional cases one or more Co-Chairs can be invited from outside the Steering Group if they can bring in exceptional expertise or experience or if no other candidates have come forward. In such cases the Steering Group will need to invite them as members first after which he/she/they can be elected (Co-)Chair(s). Non-voting members are ineligible to serve as Co-Chair.
* When (Co-)Chair(s) step down after one or two terms they may remain as members of the Steering Group and Executive Committee for the subsequent term. They should inform the OBIS Programme Manager at the time they inform of their decision to step down as co-chair.
* When Co-Chairs step down after one or two terms, they will become Past Co-Chairs and will be invited to provide guidance to the incoming Co-Chairs during the first term of the new Co-Chairs. This will be a voluntary service to the new Co-Chairs and the outgoing Co-Chairs may decline.
* Co-Chairs should inform the OBIS Programme Manager and IODE Secretariat of their desire to step down at least 6 months before the expiry of their term of office or next regular meeting of the Steering Group, whichever comes first. This will allow the Programme Manager and IODE Secretariat to start the election procedure for the new Co-Chairs.
* The Co-Chairs are not involved in the day-to-day implementation of OBIS which is the remit of the OBIS Programme Manager.
* Nominations for Co-Chairs shall be accepted from members of the SG-OBIS as either nomination on behalf of another or self-nominations.
